# Colette
A keyboard designed to be ergonomic, clean, convenient, maintainable, and versatile.
It is optimized for English, but can type every character supported by the US International layout (though it's not followed.)
By default, it uses Colemak Mod-DH with a few changes to punctuation.

# Software used:
Kicad, Pycharm, FreeCAD, QMK, and Keyboard-Layout-Editor.com

# Firmware:
To compile & flash formware, install qmk system-wide and run bf.sh.
When it's "waiting for drive," plug in the PICO. WARNING: the script will delete qmk firmware monorepo tree. Backup any changes.
